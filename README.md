Key Features:
GitOps Workflow: ArgoCD uses Git as the source of truth for defining and managing the desired state of applications. This enables version-controlled, audited, and easy-to-rollback deployments.
Real-Time Application Monitoring: Continuously monitors applications running in the cluster, ensuring that any divergence from the desired state is highlighted, with options for auto-reconciliation.
Declarative Application Management: Supports defining applications as Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, Kustomize applications, or other templated formats, and manages the lifecycle of these applications.
Secure and Scalable: Offers robust RBAC for multi-team environments, integrates with existing authentication systems, and is scalable for large Kubernetes deployments.
Self-Healing: Can automatically rollback or repair applications if they drift from the declared Git state.
Use Cases:
Managing Kubernetes clusters using GitOps principles.
Ensuring consistency across different environments (development, staging, production).
Version-controlled, auditable deployments for teams adopting continuous delivery practices.
ArgoCD is a powerful tool for teams aiming to adopt GitOps, providing transparency, control, and automation for Kubernetes application delivery.

Quick Start:
Install ArgoCD in your Kubernetes cluster.
Connect a Git repository containing your Kubernetes manifests.
Deploy and manage your applications using the ArgoCD UI, CLI, or API.
